//String special Characters 
//Because strings must be written within quotes, C# will misunderstand
//this string and generate an error.

string txt = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";

//The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the blackslash escape character 
//The blackslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters.

//The sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string:

string txt = "We are the so-called \"Viking" from the north.";

//the sequence \' inserts a single quote in a string:
string txt = "It\'s alright.";

//The sequence \\ inserts a single backlslash in a string:
string txt = "The character \\ is called backslash.";  */
