//String Interpolation is which substitutes values of variable into
//placeholders in a string. Note, thay you do not worry about spaces, like with concatenation
string firsName = "John";
string lastName = "Doe";
string name = $"My full name is: {firsName} {lastName}";

//NOTE:
//That you have to use the dollar sign ($) when using the string
//interpolation method. String interpolation was introduced in C# version 6 */
