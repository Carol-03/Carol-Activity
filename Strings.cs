//and certain operations on strings.For example the length of a string can be found
//with the Length property:
string txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
Console.WriteLine("The length of the txt string is:" + txt.Length);

//Other Methods
//There are many string methods available, for example ToUpper() and 
//ToLower(), which returns a copy of the string converted to uppercase or lowercase
string txt2 = "Hello World";
